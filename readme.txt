This is the Ozzie's Glass website.
Right now it's just a single image representing the functional website...all changes first need to be hashed out.

Some Concerns:
-That product gallery isn't exactly clear to me. I first though you were going to use that image gallery thing that you sent me the link to...it starts looking like that. But then it goes to a page with multiple sliders and the top slider has a close button??? Do the two sliders pop up in a popup window? 
    -OK, I downloaded the gallery from the link you sent me...haven't tried it yet.
